                away in a journal! I also like to bake, create art, and code. Click on the link below to see some of my favorite desserts! <br>

                <p style="font-family:georgia">Appetizer, main course, or dessert? Well I'll tell all three! My favorite appetizer is spinach and artichoke dip with <br>
                    tortilla chips. Gnocchi is my favorite main course. It's made of cheese, cheese, and even more cheese! <br> And dessert...hmmm. I can't choose one! I love cakes, macarons, tiramisu, 
                    and many more!</p>

                <p style="font-family:georgia">Winning a state-wide essay competition is one of my proudest achievements. When I learnt I won, I was so overflowed with joy <br>
                    That the message and importance only sank in afterward! Another one of my proudest achievements was baking macarons. <br>
                    The outcome didn't look that good, but it tasted amazing!</p>
