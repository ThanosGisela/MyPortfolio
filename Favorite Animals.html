           <h3> The Quokka</h3>
           Quokkas are small marsupials that only live on an island in Australia. Through studies, they are considered to be one of 
           the happiest animals on Earth. Their bone structure makes them look like they always have a smile on their face! <br>
           They look like a smaller and chubbier version of a kangaroo.

           <h3> The Alpaca</h3>
           Alpacas are farm animals with a fluffy coat. They are similar to llamas, but have key features that make them diiferent. <br>
           One of these features is that they have a soft coat unlike llamas' rough ones. They are also smaller, and live in different regions. <br>

           <h3> The Beluga Whale</h3>
           Belugas whales are a type of (you guessed it) whales that live in the artic region. They prefer cold, icy waters. They are 
           usually an off-white color, and have a streamlined body. They have a slight bump on their head that makes them easily <br>
           recognizable.
