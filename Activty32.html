        My name is Sapphire. <br>
        I am a pro youtube gamer and a blogger. <br>
        I like coding too! <br>
        My favorite programming language is Python. <br>
        I am a Harry Potter fan as well! I like the friendship of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.</p>

    <h5>Ron:          No.</h5>    
    <h5>Hermione:          Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.</h5> 
    <h5>Ron:          Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!</h5>
    <h5>{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}</h5>
    <h5>Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? 
        of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and the've all worked for me.</h5> </div></div> <br>
