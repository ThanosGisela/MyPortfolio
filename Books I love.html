             <h4>Spy School</h4> 
              Spy School is a serier for middle grade written by the author Stuart Gibbs. It is about a boy (Ben Ripley) who is recruited <br>
              to a top secret espionage training academy. Despite  Ben's special gift for math, he had been brought to the academy as a <br>
              patsy. This immediately had Ben in trouble's way. With devious plots, astounding betrayals, and amazing descriptions, Spy School <br>
              is easily one of my favorite series.

                 Appetizer, main course, or dessert? Well I'll tell all three! My favorite appetizer is spinach and artichoke dip with <br>
                 tortilla chips. Gnocchi is my favorite main course. It's made of cheese, cheese, and even more cheese! <br> And dessert...hmmm. I can't choose one! I love cakes, macarons, tiramisu, 
                 and many more!

                 Winning a state-wide essay competition is one of my proudest achievements. When I learnt I won, I was so overflowed with joy <br>
                That the message and importance only sank in afterward! Another one of my proudest achievements was baking macarons. <br>
                The outcome didn't look that good, but it tasted amazing!
