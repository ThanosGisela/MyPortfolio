    <h3>  <p style="font-family:Cursive">A city of <big>culture, art,</big> and <big>fashion.</big> Paris has <em>amazing</em> museums, filled 
        with astounding pieces. Holding Da Vinci's, Monet's, Van Gogh's artwork, just to name a few. And if that isn't enough, there's Gustav 
        Eiffel's <em>masterpiece</em>. The one, the only, the Eiffel tower! Paris is my dream vacation.
